### Hi there 👋

I am a data scientist with a Masters degree in Business Intelligence and Analytics. I am currently studying  Post Graduate Program in Data Science at the University of Texas at Austin (distance learning). I have experience in the data science process from data acquisition and cleaning to model evaluation. 

I enjoy turning data into actionable insights and telling stories through data visualisation. With a knack for problem-solving and a keen eye for detail, i bring insights and recommendations to every business problem that can be addressed with data.

Please feel free to look through my projects pinned to my page.
